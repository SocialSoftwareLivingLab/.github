# What is S2l2?
S2L2 stands for Social Software Living Lab. It aims to prepare students for responsible and ethical software development, using modern and innovative techniques, while they act as problem solvers using their skills to provide solutions for society. This way, students explore the concept of Social Software Engineering in practice when delivering social change (software) instruments for the community beyond the university.  

# Where is it?
S2L2 activities take place everywhere since remote activities are welcome. Physically, it is hosted in the [LASER](https://laser.ic.unicamp.br) laboratory at [Unicamp](www.unicamp.br).
